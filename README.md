## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Video Platform Implementation for Reality Check Guide

This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive video platform for the Reality Check Guide application, designed specifically for creators to monetize their content through a pay-per-video model with integrated wallet and payment systems.

### üéØ Key Features

#### **Video Rules for Creators**
- **Free First Video Intro**: The first 1-minute video introduction uploaded by a creator is always free for all viewers

- **Downloadable Videos**: Purchased videos can be downloaded by verified buyers
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Creators can set custom pricing after selling at least 15 videos

#### **Wallet + Payment Flow**
- **Stripe Integration**: Full payment goes to Admin's Stripe account first
- **Commission System**: Configurable commission rate (default 30%) managed by admin
- **Creator Wallet Tracking**: Each creator has a wallet balance tracking earnings
- **Payout System**: Creators can request payouts from their wallet balance

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

#### **Database Structure**
- `videos` - Video content with enhanced fields (learning objectives, prerequisites, difficulty level)
- `wallets` - Creator wallet balances and transaction history
- `wallet_transactions` - Detailed transaction log for all wallet activities
- `orders` - Video purchase records with commission calculations
- `payouts` - Creator payout requests and processing status
- `admin_settings` - Configurable platform settings (commission rates, pricing caps)

#### **Models & Relationships**
- **User Model**: Extended with wallet, orders, and payout relationships

### üöÄ Implementation Details

#### **Commission System**
```php
// Automatic commission calculation
$earnings = Order::calculateEarnings($videoPrice, $commissionRate);
// Returns: ['commission_amount' => $7.50, 'creator_earning' => $17.50]
```

#### **Wallet Operations**
```php
// Add earnings to creator wallet
$wallet->addCredit($amount, $description, $metadata);

// Request payout
$wallet->reserveForPayout($amount);

// Process payout
$wallet->deduct($amount, $description, $metadata);
```
